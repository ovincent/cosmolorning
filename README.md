Here you will find some of my Jupyter Notebooks as I explore the concepts gravitational lensing and machine learning.

- 2nd_order_distortion.ipynb : Implementation of the first and second order distortion from chapters 2.5 et 2.6 of "Introduction to Gravitational Lensing" lecture scripts by Massimo Meneghetti.
- SIE_lens_sim : simplified simulation of a SIE profile lens for a galaxy. Inspired from Yashar et al. (2017).
